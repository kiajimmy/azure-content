# Learn about SQL Database backups


Database backups are an essential part of any business continuity and disaster recovery strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion. SQL Database automatically creates a local database backup every five minutes and uses Azure read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) to provide geo-redundancy. Use local database backups to [restore a database to a point in time](sql-database-point-in-time-restore-portal.md) on the same server. Use geo-redundant backups to [restore the database to a different geographical region](sql-database-geo-restore-portal.md).

This diagram shows SQL Database running in the US East region. It creates a database backup every five minutes, which it stores locally to Azure Read Access Geo-redundant Storage (RA-GRS). Azure uses geo-replication to copy the database backups to a paired data center in the US West region.

A SQL database backup includes both local database backups and geo-redundant backups. These backups are created automatically and at no additional charge. You don't need to do anything to make them happen.

For local backups, SQL Database uses SQL Server technology to create [full](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms186289.aspx), [differential](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms175526.aspx ), and [transaction log](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191429.aspx) backups. The transaction log backups happen every five minutes, which allows you to do a point-in-time restore to the same server that hosts the database. When you restore a database, the service figures out which full, differential, and transaction log backups need to be restored.

Use a local database backup to:

- Restore a database to a point-in-time within the retention period. With a database backup you can restore a database to a point-in-time, restore a deleted database to the time it was deleted, or restore a database to another geographical region. To perform a restore, see [restore a database from a database backup](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md).

- Copy a database to a SQL server in the same or different region. The copy is transactionally consistent with the current SQL Database. To perform a copy, see [database copy](sql-database-copy.md).

- Archive a database backup beyond the backup retention period. To perform an archive, [export a SQL database to a BACPAC](sql-database-export.md) file. You can then archive the BACPAC to long-term storage and store it beyond your retention period. Or, use the BACPAC to transfer a copy of your database to SQL Server, either on-premises or in an Azure virtual machine (VM).

For geo-redundant backups, SQL Database uses [Azure Storage replication](../storage/storage-redundancy.md). SQL Database stores local database backup files in a [Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) account. Azure replicates the backup files to a [paired data center](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md). 

Use a geo-redundant backup to:

- Restore a database to a different geographical region in case you cannot access the database backup from your primary database region. 

>[AZURE.NOTE] In Azure storage, the term *replication* refers to copying files from one location to another. SQL's *database replication* refers to keeping to multiple secondary databases synchronized with a primary database. 


## How much backup storage is included at no cost?

SQL Database provides up to 200% of your maximum provisioned database storage as backup storage at no additional cost. For example, if you have a Standard DB instance with a provisioned DB size of 250 GB, you have 500 GB of backup storage at no additional charge. If your database exceeds the provided backup storage, you can choose to reduce the retention period by contacting Azure Support. Another option is to pay for extra backup storage that is billed at the standard Read-Access Geographically Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) rate. 

## How often do backups happen?

For local database backups, full database backups happen weekly, differential database backups happen hourly, and transaction log backups happen every five minutes. The first full backup is scheduled immediately after a database is created. It usually completes within 30 minutes, but it can take longer when the database is of a significant size. For example, the initial backup can take longer on a restored database or a database copy. After the first full backup, all further backups are scheduled automatically and managed silently in the background. The exact timing of full and [differential](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms175526.aspx) database backups is determined as it balances the overall system workload. 

For geo-redundant backups, full and differential backups are copied according to the Azure Storage replication schedule.

## How long do you keep my backups?

Each SQL Database backup has a retention period that is based on the [service-tier](sql-database-service-tiers.md) of the database. The retention period for a database in the:

- Basic service tier is seven days.
- Standard service tier is 35 days.
- Premium service tier is 35 days.


If you downgrade your database from the Standard or Premium service tiers to Basic, the backups are saved for seven days. All existing backups older than seven days are no longer available. 

If you upgrade your database from the Basic service tier to Standard or Premium, SQL Database keeps existing backups until they are 35 days old. It keeps new backups as they occur for 35 days.
 
If you delete a database, SQL Database keeps the backups in the same way it would for an online database. For example, suppose you delete a Basic database that has a retention period of seven days. A backup that is four days old is saved for three more days.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you delete the Azure SQL server that hosts SQL Databases, all databases that belong to the server are also deleted and cannot be recovered. You cannot restore a deleted server.
