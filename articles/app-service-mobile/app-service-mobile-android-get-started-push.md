# Add Push Notifications to your Android App

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push.md)]

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add push notifications to the [Android quick start] project so that every time a record is inserted, a push notification is sent. This tutorial is based on the [Android quick start] tutorial, which you must complete first. If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you must add the push notification extension package to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

## Prerequisites

The following items are needed to complete this tutorial:

* [Google account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302) with a verified email address.

* An IDE depending on your project's backend:

	* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) if this app has a Node.js backend.

	* [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=391934) or later if this app has a .Net backend.

* Complete the [quickstart tutorial](app-service-mobile-android-get-started.md).

## Create a project that supports Firebase Cloud Messaging

[AZURE.INCLUDE [notification-hubs-enable-firebase-cloud-messaging](../../includes/notification-hubs-enable-firebase-cloud-messaging.md)]

## Create a Notification Hub

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-create-notification-hub](../../includes/app-service-mobile-create-notification-hub.md)]

## Configure the Mobile App backend for sending push requests

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-android-configure-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-android-configure-push-for-firebase.md)]

## Enable push notifications for the server project

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-configure-push-google](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-configure-push-google.md)]

## Add push notifications to your app

In this section, you enable your Android app project to handle push notifications.

### Verify Android SDK Version

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-verify-android-sdk-version](../../includes/app-service-mobile-verify-android-sdk-version.md)]

Your next step is to install Google Play services. Google Cloud Messaging has some minimum API level requirements for development and testing, which the **minSdkVersion** property in the Manifest must conform to.

If you are testing with an older device, then consult [Set Up Google Play Services SDK] to determine how low you can set this value, and set it appropriately.

### Add Google Play Services to the project

[AZURE.INCLUDE [Add Play Services](../../includes/app-service-mobile-add-google-play-services.md)]

### Add code

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-android-getting-started-with-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-android-getting-started-with-push.md)]

## Test the app against the published mobile service

You can test the app by directly attaching an Android phone with a USB cable, or by using a virtual device in the emulator.

## More

* Tags allow you to target segmented customers with pushes. [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md) shows you how to add tags to a device installation.
