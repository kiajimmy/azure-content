# Using the Docker VM Extension to deploy your environment

Docker is a popular container management and imaging platform that allows you to quickly work with containers on Linux (and Windows as well). With Azure, you have the flexibility to deploy Docker in a few different manners depending on your needs:

- To quickly prototype an app, you can [use the Docker Machine Azure driver](./virtual-machines-linux-docker-machine.md) to deploy Docker hosts within Azure.
- The Docker VM Extension for Azure virtual machines is used for template-based deployments. This approach can integrate with Azure Resource Manager template deployments and includes all the related benefits such as role-based access, diagnostics, and post-deployment configuration.
- The Docker VM Extension also supports Docker Compose. Docker Compose uses a declarative YAML file to take a developer-modeled application across any environment and generate a consistent deployment.
- You can also [deploy a full Docker Swarm cluster on Azure Container Services](../container-service/container-service-deployment.md) for production-ready, scalable deployments that use the additional scheduling and management tools provided by Swarm.

This article focuses on using Resource Manager templates to deploy the Docker VM Extension in a custom, production-ready environment that you define.

## Azure Docker VM Extension for template deployments

The Azure Docker VM Extension installs and configures the Docker daemon, Docker client, and Docker Compose in your Linux virtual machine. The extension is also used to define and deploy container applications using Docker Compose. You have additional controls over using Docker Machine or creating the Docker host yourself, making it suited for more robust developer or production environments.

Using Azure Resource Manager, you can create and deploy templates that define the entire structure of your environment. Templates allow you to define the Docker hosts, storage, Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), diagnostics, etc. You can [read more about Resource Manager](../resource-group-overview.md) and templates to better understand some of the benefits. By using Resource Manager templates, you are also able to reproduce the deployments as needed in the future.

## Deploy a template with the Docker VM Extension:

Let's use an existing quick-start template to show how to deploy an Ubuntu VM that has the Docker VM Extension installed. You can view the template here: [Simple deployment of an Ubuntu VM with Docker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu). You also need the [latest Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md) in Resource Manager mode (`azure config mode arm`).

Deploy the template using the Azure CLI, specifying a name for our new resource group (here `myDockerResourceGroup`) along with the template URI:

```
azure group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West US" \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/azuredeploy.json
```

Answer the prompts for naming your storage account, username and password, and DNS name. You should see output similar to the following example:

```
info:    Executing command group create
+ Getting resource group myResourceGroup
+ Updating resource group myResourceGroup
info:    Updated resource group myResourceGroup
info:    Supply values for the following parameters
newStorageAccountName: mystorageaccount
adminUsername: ops
adminPassword: P@ssword!
dnsNameForPublicIP: mypublicip
+ Initializing template configurations and parameters
+ Creating a deployment
info:    Created template deployment "azuredeploy"
data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup
data:    Name:                myResourceGroup
data:    Location:            westus
data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
data:    Tags: null
data:
info:    group create command OK

```

The Azure CLI returns you to the prompt after only a few seconds, but in the background the template is being deployed in to the resource group you created. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to finish before trying to SSH to the VM.

You can obtain details about the deployment and the DNS name of the VM by using the `azure vm show` command. In the following example, replace `myResourceGroup` with the name you specified in the previous step (the default VM name from the template is `myDockerVM`, so leave that name as-is):

```bash
azure vm show -g myResourceGroup -n myDockerVM
info:    Executing command vm show
+ Looking up the VM "myDockerVM"
+ Looking up the NIC "myVMNicD"
+ Looking up the public ip "myPublicIPD"
data:    Id                              :/subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/mydockerresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/MyDockerVM
data:    ProvisioningState               :Succeeded
data:    Name                            :MyDockerVM
data:    Location                        :westus
data:    Type                            :Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
[...]
data:
data:    Network Profile:
data:      Network Interfaces:
data:        Network Interface #1:
data:          Primary                   :true
data:          MAC Address               :00-0D-3A-33-D3-95
data:          Provisioning State        :Succeeded
data:          Name                      :myVMNicD
data:          Location                  :westus
data:            Public IP address       :13.91.107.235
data:            FQDN                    :mypublicip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com]
data:
data:    Diagnostics Instance View:
info:    vm show command OK
```

Near the top of the output, you see the `ProvisioningState` of the VM. When this displays `Succeeded`, the deployment has finished and you can SSH to the VM.

Towards the end of the output, `FQDN` displays the fully qualified domain name based on the DNS name you provided and the location you selected. This FQDN is what you use to SSH to the VM in the remaining steps.


## Deploy your first nginx container
Once the deployment has finished, SSH to your new Docker host using the DNS name you provided during deployment:

```bash
ssh ops@mypublicip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

Let's try to run an nginx container:

```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

You should see output similar to the following example:

```
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
efd26ecc9548: Pull complete
a3ed95caeb02: Pull complete
a48df1751a97: Pull complete
8ddc2d7beb91: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:2ca2638e55319b7bc0c7d028209ea69b1368e95b01383e66dfe7e4f43780926d
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
b6ed109fb743a762ff21a4606dd38d3e5d35aff43fa7f12e8d4ed1d920b0cd74
```

Examine the container running on your host using `sudo docker ps`:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                         NAMES
b6ed109fb743        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon off"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 443/tcp   adoring_payne
```

To see your container in action, open up a web browser and enter the DNS name you specified during deployment:

![Running ngnix container](./media/virtual-machines-linux-dockerextension/nginxrunning.png)

You may wish to configure the Docker daemon TCP port, security, or deploy containers using Docker Compose. For more information, see the [Azure Virtual Machine Extension for Docker GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docker-extension/).

## Docker VM Extension JSON template reference

This example used a quick-start template. To deploy the Azure Docker VM Extension with your own Resource Manager templates, add the following JSON:

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
  "name": "[concat(variables('vmName'), '/DockerExtension'))]",
  "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Extensions",
    "type": "DockerExtension",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.1",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {},
    "protectedSettings": {}
  }
}
```
